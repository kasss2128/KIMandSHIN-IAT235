                        <p>Jean Prouvé was a French industrial designer and architect known for his innovative approach to design and construction.</p>
                        <p>Functionality: Prouvé believed that design should prioritize function over form, rather than the other way around.</p>
                        <p>Rationality: Prouvé believed that industrial production could bring about greater efficiency and affordability in design.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>Simplicity:Prouvé believed that simplicity was essential for good design, and that unnecessary decoration detracted from the function of an object.</p>
                        <p>Collaboration: Prouvé believed that collaboration was essential for successful designs, as different perspectives could lead to better solutions.</p>
                        <p>Prouvé's design philosophy focused on function, rationality, simplicity, and collaboration.</p>

Her work emphasised simplicity, efficiency, and new materials and technology. Perriand felt that excellent design should serve society's needs and that designers should develop functional and beautiful items to better people's lives. She liked designing furniture and architecture for modern living and working. Perriand used steel, aluminium, and plastic to make lightweight, flexible furniture that was easy to produce and move. She also stressed ergonomics in design, making body-friendly furniture. Perriand's design philosophy of simplicity, functionality, and invention influenced modern design.</p>
